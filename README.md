# Js-Todo-List

##### Note:
I know to-do lists are everywhere, but this was one of my very first projects from school that I felt good about finishing it. So it's special to me.
I was fairly new to web development (and I still am), so I had to do some documentation reading and online searching to get tasks working properly,
Specially setting up the local storage, it was quite a class.
I'm proud of this one here :smily

#### Project Requests:

- List new tasks.
- Line-through tasks that were done my clicking on them.
- A button to remove finished tasks.
- A button to remove all tasks.
- Local Storage for both adding and removing tasks.
