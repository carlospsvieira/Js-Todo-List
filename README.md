# Js-Todo-List with Local Storage

##### Note:
I know to-do lists are everywhere, but this was one of my very first projects from school.
I was fairly new to web development (and I still am), so I had to do some documentation reading and online searching to get tasks working properly,
Specially setting up the local storage, it was quite a class.
I'm proud of this one here.

#### Technologies:
- JavaScript
- Css (bootstrap)
- HTML

#### Project Requests:
- Line-through tasks that were done my clicking on them.
- A button to remove finished tasks.
- A button to remove all tasks.
- Local Storage for both adding and removing tasks.
